1*What is the difference between if else and if-elseif in Java?
        A simple if-else contains one condition, which if not met would be a default solution, whereas a if-else if provides two conditions if the first is not met, it leads to the “else if” statement and ends with the default else solutions. There can be several “else if” statements.
2* Can an if else statement be nested within another if else statement?
        An if statement can have a block of codes that contains another if statement.
3* What is the purpose of using the switch statement in Java?
        A switch statement executes a block of code based on the conditions it meets. It goes through the various cases until the requirement is met.
4* Can a switch statement have multiple cases with the same value?
        There should not be multiple cases with the same value because each case code block ends with a “break” keyword which will execute once the condition is met and the remaining cases will not be executed. The next case, even though it has the same value, will not be executed
5* How does the for loop work in Java and what is its syntax?
        The “For Loop” is executed if there is a need to run a block of code several times with different values within a certain range.
            Syntax:
            for (initiation; condition; increment){...
            //block of code;}
6* What are the different ways to terminate a for loop in Java?
         A loop is terminated when it meets the final value of the range provided.
7* How does the while loop work in Java and what is its syntax?
        A while loop checks the condition first which if met, the block of code will not be executed.
            Syntax:
            while (condition){...
            //block of code
            increment}
8* What is the difference between a while loop and a do while loop in Java?
        A while lopp checks the condition before print and a do while loop prints the first iteration and then checks the condition.
9* What is the purpose of using a do while loop in Java?
        A do while loop will atleast print the first value and then see if the condition applies.
10* How do you use the break statement in a for loop or while loop in Java?
        If applied before a print statement, will not print the last iteration.
11* What is the use of the continue statement in Java loops?
        Will continue after a break statement
12* What is an infinite loop and how do you prevent it in Java?

13* Can a for loop be nested inside another for loop in Java?
        It is possible to have nested loops.
14* Can a while loop be nested inside another while loop in Java?
        It is possible to have nested while loops.
15* What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop when it comes to executing the loop body?
16* How do you use the for each loop in Java and what is its syntax?
        Enter the array in the loop condition. The loop with interate per element.

        for (int a: array){
            System.out.print(a);
            }
17* What is the difference between a for loop and a for each loop in Java?
        For each loop is only applies to arrays.
18* What is the use of labels in Java loops and how are they used?
19* Can the switch statement be used with variables other than int or char in Java?
        Switch statements can even be Strings, therefore it can be any data type.
20* What is the recommended use case for if else, ifelseif, switch, for loop, while loop, and do while loop in Java?
    If/else is used for a condition and a defualt condition.
    If/Elseif is used for two conditions.
    Switch: A more organized form for multiple if/else conditions.
    For loop: Executes a code multiple time and iterates within a range.
    While loop: Check the condition before executing
    Do while loop: Prints the condition once and then checks the condition.
