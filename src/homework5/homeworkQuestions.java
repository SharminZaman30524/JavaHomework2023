Recursive method Problems
Fibonacci sequence: Write a recursive function that takes an integer n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. So, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

Factorial: Write a recursive function that takes an integer n as input and returns the factorial of n. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Sum of digits: Write a recursive function that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of its digits.

Palindrome: Write a recursive function that takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a palindrome, and false otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

Binary search: Write a recursive function that takes a sorted array of integers and a target integer as input, and returns the index of the target integer in the array if it exists, or -1 otherwise. Use binary search algorithm to achieve the result. (Same as the example provided for binary search lecture)
