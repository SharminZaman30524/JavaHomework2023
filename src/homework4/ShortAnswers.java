1*  What is a nested for loop in Java?
        A child loop within a parent loop.
2* Can you give an example of a nested for loop in Java?
        When accessing values of a two-dimensional loop, a nested loop can be applied.
3* What is the purpose of using nested for loops in Java?
        If one condition is needed to fulfill the parent loop, a nested loop can be applied.
4* Can a for loop be nested inside an if statement in Java?
        A loop can be applied to an if statement and not be performed in the else statement.
5* What is the syntax for a nested if else statement in Java?
    if(){
        if(){
        }else{
            }
    }else{
        }
6* Can you give an example of a nested if else statement in Java?
        Check if a number greater than 10 is odd or even.
7* How does the if else statement inside a for loop work in Java?
        The if/else statement will iterate given the condition/range of the loop.
8* What is exception handling in Java?
        Given is one is dealing with a runtime (unchecked) or compile time (checked) exception, a try/catch block or throws keyword is applied.
9* What is the purpose of using exception handling in Java?
        To run a block of code with the exception given a catch block commits to another code.
10* Can you give an example of how to use try-catch in Java for exception handling?
        An arithmetic exception such as divide by zero.
11* What is a catch block in Java exception handling?
        Catch block is the piece of code that contains the exception such as nullPointer, arithmetic, or outOfBoundIndex.
12* How can you throw an exception in Java?
        The throws keyword is applied to the method after the name and parameters of the method.
13* What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java?
        Checked exceptions are compile time, the error is seen in the IDE and can be handled while constructing the code.
        Unchecked exceptions are run time, and the exception is read in the console once the code is executed.
14* What is the finally block in Java exception handling?
        Used after a try-catch block to apply the code no matter what.
15 * How does the finally block work in conjunction with the try-catch block in Java?
        Finally is applied at the end of the code an executes regardless of the exception.
16 * What is a 1D array in Java?
        In array with one element per index.
17* How do you declare a 1D array in Java?
        1. int a [] = {elements}
        2. int[] a = new a[index];
            a[0]=1;
            a[1]=5;
            int[index-1]=element;

18* Can you give an example of how to initialize a 1D array in Java?
        The element can be in the curly braces as the array is declared in the same line.
        Each values can also be initialized separately given the index.
19* How do you access elements of a 1D array in Java?
        Call the array and indicate the index.
20* What are the differences between a 1D array and a 2D array in Java?
        2D arrays deal with rows and columns, the index of columns corresponds to its respective row.
21* What is an escape sequence in Java?
        Given a string can not be formatted, tabs, backspace, and newlines can be applied within the string.
22* Can you give an example of an escape sequence in Java?
        \n is newline = It prints a new line.
23* How do you print a new line in Java using escape sequences?
        System.out.print("\n");
24* What is the purpose of using wrapper classes in Java?
        A primitive type data that has its own class and methods that can be called using an object.
25* Can you give an example of how to use a wrapper class in Java?
        Integer name = Integer.valueOf(50);
            name.intValue;
25* What is type casting in Java?

26* Can you explain the difference between upcasting and downcasting in Java?
27* How do you cast an object from one type to another in Java?
28* What is the java.util.Date class in Java and what is its purpose?
29* Can you give an example of how to use the java.util.Date class to display the current date and time in Java?
30* What is the difference between java.util.Date and java.sql.Date in Java?
31* Can you give an example of how to format a date using the SimpleDateFormat class in Java?
32* How do you compare two dates in Java using the java.util.Date class?
33* Can you explain how to use the Calendar class in Java to manipulate dates?
34* How do you subtract two dates in Java to find the difference between them in terms of days, months or years?
